## In Progress

### Data Generation
- [ ] Implement more diverse data generators (e.g., image, audio)
- [ ] Create connectors for various data sources (databases, APIs, web scraping)

### Task Creation
- [ ] Implement concrete task creators for common tasks (QA, summarization, classification)
- [ ] Develop a system for chaining multiple task creators

### LLM Integration
- [ ] Implement concrete LLM providers (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
- [ ] Develop caching and rate limiting for LLM providers

### Evaluation and Quality Control
- [ ] Implement basic evaluation metrics
- [ ] Create a system for automated quality checks

## Upcoming

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement advanced data augmentation techniques
- [ ] Develop multi-task learning support
- [ ] Create a prompt management system with version control

### Scalability and Performance
- [ ] Implement distributed processing capabilities
- [ ] Optimize for large-scale dataset creation

### Visualization and Monitoring
- [ ] Create a basic web interface for exploring generated datasets
- [ ] Integrate with experiment tracking tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases)

### Documentation and Community
- [ ] Write comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create tutorials and best practices guides
- [ ] Set up a GitHub repository with contribution guidelines

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement bias detection and mitigation tools
- [ ] Develop active learning strategies for data quality improvement
- [ ] Create interfaces for human-in-the-loop validation
- [ ] Implement model fine-tuning capabilities
- [ ] Develop custom dashboards for monitoring data generation processes
